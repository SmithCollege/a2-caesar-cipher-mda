General comments on your experience with this assignment:

It was fun experimenting with encoding/decoding strings: seeing what would happen if I decoded this sentence using this key, etc. It did help me understand Arrays vs ArrayLists better, and I think that actually writing the code for the Caesar Cipher helped me wrap my head around what all of this is actually supposed to be doing. It was difficult, at first, to understand the process of the Caeser Cipher, everything it does to get from the given String to the encoded message, and definitely frustrating when tests weren't passing, but I was able to make it work, and it was very satisfying in the end.
